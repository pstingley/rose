The best poets alive 
today, write poetry in the 
form of computer programs.  

Code is a form of 
poetry that uses a 
human language 

in a formalized 
structure to express meaning
at higher levels 

Code is written for 
humans.  Computers only 
understand zeros

and ones.  Both people
and computers interpret
same things differently

Do any two mminds 
ever interpret the same 
thing in the same way?
